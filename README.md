### KITTI Tracking Performance (YOLOv8 + BYTETrack on Seq 0000)

| **Metric** | IDF1 |  IDP  | IDR |  Rcll | Prcn | GT | MT | PT | ML | FP | FN | IDs | FM  | MOTA | MOTP | IDt | IDa | IDm|
|------------|------|-------|-----|-------|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|------|------|-----|-----|----|
| **Value** |69.5% | 65.1% |74.5% |88.9%| 77.7%|  9 |  6|   2  | 1  | 62|  27 |  14 |  6  | 57.6% | 0.247 |12  | 5 |   3|


> IDF1 = 69.5% -> Good identity consistency across frames

> IDP/IDR -> Balanced precision (65.1%) and recall (74.5%) of track IDs

> FP / FN = 62 / 27 â†’ False positives slightly higher, possible over-detections

> IDs = 14 -> Identity switches still present, can improve

> MOTA = 57.6% -> Overall multi-object tracking accuracy is reasonable for basic IoU-based tracking

> MT / PT / ML = 6 cars well-tracked, 2 partially, 1 mostly lost
